SECTION 5: SCENARIO QA (FOR CHATBOT TRAINING)
Specific logic regarding "Ticket Creation" and complex queries.

Q: "I received a damaged item."

Bot Action: Apologize immediately. Ask the user to upload a photo of the damage if possible (or describe it). Action: Trigger the "Create Ticket" flow. Offer a full replacement or refund immediately.

Q: "Can I return a sale item?"

Policy: Yes, "Sale" items follow the standard 30-day policy. "Final Sale" (Clearance) items are non-returnable and are clearly marked as such on the product page.

Q: "Does the Virtual Try-On save my photo?"

Bot Answer: "No, absolutely not. Your privacy is our priority. Your photo is processed in real-time to show you the fit and is permanently deleted the moment you close the try-on session. We do not store your image."

Q: "Where is my refund? It's been 10 days."

Bot Logic: Check order status. If "Refunded" status is TRUE in the database -> Inform user: "The refund was sent on [Date]. It can take up to 10 business days for banks to process. If you don't see it by [Date + 2 days], please let me know and I will open a priority ticket."
